**SMEAG_toolbox** is a R toolbox based on [EXstat](https://github.com/super-lou/EXstat) and [CARD](https://github.com/super-lou/CARD) packages. Its main objective is to provide a simple way of interacting with all these codes to carry out hydrological stationnarity analysis for the Agence de l'Eau Adour-Garonne (SMEAG).

This project was carried out for National Research Institute for Agriculture, Food and the Environment (Institut National de Recherche pour l‚ÄôAgriculture, l‚ÄôAlimentation et l‚ÄôEnvironnement, [INRAE](https://agriculture.gouv.fr/inrae-linstitut-national-de-recherche-pour-lagriculture-lalimentation-et-lenvironnement) in french).
